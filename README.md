## How to Download and Run

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lailacypher/ddos-attack.git
Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
Change into the project directory:

bash
Copiar
Editar
cd ddos-attack
Step 3: Install Python 3 (if not already installed)
If you don't have Python 3 installed, download and install it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Step 4: Run the Script
Run the Python script directly from the terminal:

bash
Copiar
Editar
python3 ddos_attack.py
Step 5: Provide Input
The script will prompt you to enter the target IP and port to attack. Provide the necessary details when prompted.

Example:

yaml
Copiar
Editar
Target IP   : 192.168.0.1
Port        : 8080

### Translation of the Bash Commands and Process:

1. **Copy and Edit**
   - **Copy**: Refers to copying the code or commands from the tutorial to the terminal.
   - **Edit**: Means if you want to modify the code (e.g., change a value or behavior), you can open the file `ddos_attack.py` in a text editor (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text, or Notepad) and make the necessary changes.

2. **`python3 ddos_attack.py`**
   - This command runs the `ddos_attack.py` script in the terminal.
   - The command **python3** is used to execute Python 3 scripts. If you're on Linux or macOS and have Python 3 installed, just type `python3 ddos_attack.py` in the terminal to run the script.

3. **Step 5: Provide Input**
   - After running the script, it will prompt you for input:
     - **Target IP**: Enter the IP address of the machine or server you want to attack.
     - **Port**: Enter the port number you want to attack.

### Example of Running the Script:
1. **Running the script**:

```bash
python3 ddos_attack.py
It will display something like:

yaml
Copiar
Editar
Target IP   : 
Here, you will type the IP you want to target.

Then it will ask for the Port:

yaml
Copiar
Editar
Port        : 
And you will type the port of the target.

Conclusion:
Copy: Refers to copying and pasting the command into the terminal.

Edit: Refers to modifying the script's code.

python3 ddos_attack.py: Command to run the Python script.

Step 5 (Provide Input): The script will ask for inputs such as the IP and port of the target.
